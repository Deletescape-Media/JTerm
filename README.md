#JTerm - Simple, Platform independent, Open source

This all started as a small playground project when I didn't have that much to do at work, it then quickly turned into a bigger project. The Terminal can already be used for rather simple tasks and a good set of scripting tools is under implementation.

The sources are rather messy right now and need some clean up! If you see something you could do better, then do it better and send me a PR!
