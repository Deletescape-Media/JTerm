</ul><h2>What is JTerm?</h2><p>JTerm is a small terminal emulator containing all the basic commands a terminal needs and some more. A scripting language is also provided which will evolve alot in future releases. But the best thing about it is that it is fully open source and works on all platforms!</p><p>In terms of syntax and command names JTerm is bash oriented but it isn't explicitly a bash emulator. </p>
