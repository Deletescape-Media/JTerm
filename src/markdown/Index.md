##What is JTerm?

JTerm is a small terminal emulator containing all the basic commands a terminal needs and some more. A scripting language is also provided which will evolve alot in future releases. But the best thing about it is that it is fully open source and works on all platforms!

In terms of syntax and command names JTerm is bash oriented but it isn't explicitly a bash emulator.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/JTerm/releases)
2. Decompress the archive
3. Navigate to the `bin` directory in the JTerm folder and execute JTerm (or JTerm.bat if you are using Windows)
4. Enter the command `help` to get a list of commands and a short description of each one
5. Have fun :)
